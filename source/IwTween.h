 * The 'ease' namespace is used for functions that can modify how tweens are applied.
 * Each easing function is of the form y = f(x), where x = (0..1) and y = (0..1).
 *
 * An easing function also takes a 'value' parameter which can be used to modify the easing function;
 * for example, to specify a multiplication factor or exponential power. Note that although this
 * can be given a default input value in the header definition of the function, the way the function
 * is called (from a function pointer) means this is not respected. Therefore, any user-defined easing
 * functions should assume an input easing value of 0.0f means "no input", and set the value
 * accordingly.
